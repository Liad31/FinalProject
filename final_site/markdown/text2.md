Our model Relies on 4 different data types: text description, it\'s hashtags, the sound attached to the video and the video itself. For each data type we created a sub-model or introduced logic before combining all the outputs of the sub-models which were trained separately before into one vector and passed it through a final fully connected network. For the text description we built an attention based LSTM taking as input the words of the description represented as the vector given by [AraVec 3.0 (word2vec)](https://github.com/bakrianoo/aravec). For the hashtags we developed a weighted-KNN model, Our logic was to look at the correlation between a given hashtag and the nationalism of the posts tagged by it. We then defined a score function combining the hashtags of each post (reminds of a weighted-KNN). Our video model is the Tannet model provided by [MMaction 2.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/master/configs/recognition/tanet/README.md), with it\'s final layer cut (to allow our final model to infer more about the video itself). Finally for the post sound we created a nationalistic sounds bucket based on the nationalistic sounds we accumulated in the tagging process and look for those sounds in future posts. Combining those four together, we created our final model which outputs a nationalistic score for a given TikTok post.
