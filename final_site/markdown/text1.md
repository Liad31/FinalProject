The TikTok classifier is a tool used to identify Palestinian nationalism in TikTok.
The tool utilizes a machine learning model trained to classify Palestinian TikTok videos as either nationalistic or not.
Developed by R. Cirkin, G. Vitrak, and L. Kehila, the tool serves as our final project for our Computer Science B.A in Bar-Ilan University (BIU). We collaborated with the Department of Middle Eastern Studies of BIU, with the guidance of mentors Yossi Mann and Eli Alshech and students in their seminar.
Thanks to their guidance and the hard work of the seminar students who aided us, our model achieved outstanding performance.
The tool and its results are now available on this website. Using our tool, we can follow Palestinian nationalistic users, monitor their videos, and predict nationalistic waves in the West Bank before they burst. 
We initially defined Palestinian nationalism and characterized the kinds of videos we should be on the lookout for. After discussing this with the seminar students and our mentors, we received a green light to start collecting data (users, videos, etc...) from Tiktok. We then created a location analyzer that validates that all of our collected data is from the West bank. Then, we built the tagging site for our taggers, the seminar students, where they could tag the videos we collected. The tagged videos served as the data we later used to train our model.
After three intensive months of video tagging and model building, we finally were able to train and test our model on the labeled data.
