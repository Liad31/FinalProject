The TikTok classifier is a tool for recognizing Palestinian nationalism in TikTok.  
The tool is based on a machine learning model which was trained for classifying Palestinian TikTok videos as either nationalistic or not.  
This tool was developed by R. Cirkin, G. Vitrak and L. Kehila as the final project for our computer science B.A in Bar-Ilan University(BIU). We collaborated with the Department of Middle Eastern Studies of BIU, specifically with our mentors Y. Mann and Eli Alshech and students in their seminar.  
Thanks to their guidance and the hard work of the seminar students who helped us a lot along the way, our model achived great performance.  
The tool and its results are now available in this website. Now, using our tool we can follow Palestinian nationalistic users, monitor their videos and predict nationalistic waves in the West bank before they burst.  
At first, we had to define Palestinian nationalism and characterize the kinds of videos we should be looking out for. After discussing this with the seminar students and our mentors we got a green light to start collecting data (users, videos, etc...) from Tiktok, we created a location analyzer which tries to make sure that all our data comes from the West bank. Then, we built the tagging site for our taggers, the seminar students, where they could tag the videos we collected. this data was later used to train our model.  
After 3 intensive months of video tagging and model building, we finally were able to train & test our model on the labeled data.
